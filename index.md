## Welcome to Mike's Coding Portfolio

Here you'll find all the best coding I did for my CS 121 class.

### [P5_Tic_Tac_Toe](https://github.com/commsmartly/commsmartly.github.io/tree/master/P5_Tic_Tac_Toe)
The capstone project for the class. A game of Tic Tac Toe. I coded the game rules, AI of the computer player, all logic.   

### [P4_Reader_Of_Books](https://github.com/commsmartly/commsmartly.github.io/tree/master/P4_Reader_Of_Books)
An e-reader GUI application for loading and reading a collection of books. This application allows a user to load books, and select from a list of buttons to read them. It is an interation on the foundational work from P3_Library_Of_Books. 

### [P3_Library_Of_Books](https://github.com/commsmartly/commsmartly.github.io/tree/master/P3_Library_Of_Books)
A console-based application for organizing a collection of books. This application allows a user to add books to and remove books from the library. Users will also be able to display a list of books within the library as well as select a book to read.

### [P2_Interactive_PlayList_Analysis](https://github.com/commsmartly/commsmartly.github.io/tree/master/P2_Interactive_PlayList_Analysis)
A music analytics tool called Jukebox Hero.  The user will provide a music catalog in the form of a csv file where each row in the file represents a single song with the following values (csv): Artist, Album, Title, Duration (in secs).

The Jukebox Hero tool will allow the user to open a music catalog file, print stats about the catalog (number of songs, number of artists, number of albums, total play time), search for songs in the catalog, and display the entire catalog.

### [P1_Playlist](https://github.com/commsmartly/commsmartly.github.io/tree/master/P1_Playlist)
Creates a playlist of three song objects and does computations.

### [Activity_Lite_Brite](https://github.com/commsmartly/commsmartly.github.io/tree/master/Activity_Lite_Brite)
A GUI representation of Lite Brite, using randomized colors.

### [Activity_Wargames](https://github.com/commsmartly/commsmartly.github.io/tree/master/Activity_Wargames)
A simulated game of copyright-friendly Wargames, played from the command prompt.
