* Author: Mike Taylor
* Class: CS121 Section 4-9

## Overview

This class manages game state information and logic for a game of tic-tac-toe. It implements the TicTacToe interface. 

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:

```
$ javac myTicTacToeTester.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:

```
$ java myTicTacToeTester
```

## Description

Use the TicToeToe interface and a driver class like myTicTacToeTester or TicTacToeGUI to play the actual game. 

## Reflection

This one wasn’t nearly as difficult as the last project, but I felt like I have a much better understanding 
of how arrays and for loops work. I went back and watched the DeckOfCards videos to get refreshed on them. 
Coming into office hours helped orient me and my plan of action. I also went into the final review session that 
Alyssa held and that helped too. 

The most difficult aspect was understanding all the requirements, but it was less confusing than previous projects. 
There was a point in the project where I suddenly realized what I needed to do to complete the rest of the project. 
I entered a weird nerd-trance and coded until it was nearly finished. I was so confident that I was doing the right 
thing that I forgot to try testing it as I was going, but it turned out I didn’t even need to. That felt really good.
